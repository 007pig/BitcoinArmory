# Maintain this file in the repo so that Armory can always find info
# about the latest version.  This is a good way to document progress,
# anyway...

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.83

   - Version 0.82.1 is still the latest version
        This fake version was added solely for testing the version notification
        window.  Version 0.83 does not actually exist yet!

   - Manually check for new versions
        Use "Help"->"Armory Versions" from the main window!
      

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.82.1

   - URL/Link Creator
        Right click on an address in your address book, or press "Create 
        Clickable Link" when you get a new address.  Use this to email 
        payment requests to others, or post payment information on webpages.

   - Minimize-to-system-tray  
        The file menu now has a "Minimize" option, and you can set it to 
        minimize-by-default when you click the "x" on the top window bar.

   - Logging system implemented
        All information normally written to console is now saved to a
        log file in the Armory home directory.  This makes it much easier,
        to report bugs/crashes, especially for Windows users.  Please use 
        "File"-->"Export Log File" to save a copy and send it with your 
        bug reports. 

   - Specify Change Address (Expert Mode Only!)  
        The send-bitcoins window now has options in the bottom-left corner
        to specify how you want change outputs to be constructed.  Either 
        recycle change into existing addresses, or specify an address.  
        
   - New "MAX" button
        New button for each recipient in the send-bitcoins window.  Given
        the values already entered for other recipients and the transaction
        fee, it will compute the max spendable balance for this recipient 
        and insert it into the "Amount" field.  

   - Version Checking and Notification
        When you start Armory, it will automatically check versions.txt in
        the master branch of Armory on github.  It will then notify you if
        your version is older than the latest one.

   - Removed Bitcoin-Qt Wallet Migration
        This was causing more confusion than it was helping.  Given that 
        very few users will benefit from it anymore, it has been removed
        until the new wallet format is finished.


      


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.81

   - Export Transactions Window
        Export your transaction history in *.csv format.  You can select 
        which wallets to export, sort order, and date format.  

   - Options/Preferences Dialog
        Set your default transaction fee, date formats, usermode, and 
        system tray notifications!

   - Bug fix (Major: spend zero-conf change)
        If Armory needed to use zero-confirmation outputs to construct 
        your transaction, it would crash.  This has been fixed.
   
   - Bug fix (Major: address importing)
        There was an incompatibility between old address importing code
        and the new blockchain engine.  All import/sweep operations should
        work as expected now


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.80

   - New Blockchain Engine!
        Rewrite of the blockchain engine (under-the-hood) that won't crash when
        the blk000X.dat file splits at 2 GB.  It also makes it easier to later
        implement saving data between loads so that it only takes a long time 
        the first time you load, or when you import new addresses.

   - Balances zero-conf tx and sent-to-self change
        There was previously multiple issues with the way that Armory was adding
        up balances that included change outputs and zero-confirmation outputs.  
        This should be fixed  

   - Coinbase Transaction Display
        Coinbase transactions (such as mining in P2Pool) now display properly, 
        and will be not be considered spendable until 120 confirmations
