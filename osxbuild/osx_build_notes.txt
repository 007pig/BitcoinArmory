This directory was prepared by forum user, "picobit", and reviewed 
by the ATI team.  These notes describe what had to be done on a fresh
install of OSX 10.9 in order to get build-app.py working.

(1) Install xcode from the Apple store (free)

(2) From within xcode, install the command-line utilities
    "Xcode" --> "Preferences" --> "Downloads"

(3) You may also have to run "xcode-select --install" from the terminal.
    You will have to click through an EULA and a few other dialogs.

(4) From Red Emerald's preparation steps for compiling Armory on Mac
    (https://gist.github.com/WyseNynja/4200620), execute the following
    to install and update brew:

       $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
       $ touch ~/.bashrc
       $ echo "export CFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\"" >> ~/.bashrc
       $ echo "export ARCHFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\"" >> ~/.bashrc
       $ source ~/.bashrc
       $ brew update
       $ brew doctor

(5) Execute "brew install swig"

(6) Open cppForSwig/Makefile and comment out the DO_EXEC_WHEREISPY 
    line (around line 20).  I tried to branch around it, but it 
    didn't work for some reason.	

(7) "cd" into the osx_picobit directory, and "python build-app.py"
